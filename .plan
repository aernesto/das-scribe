A "post" is a directory containing files.

A "scribe" is a directory containing multiple "post" directories and a .scribe
file, containing metadata about the titles/creation dates/last edit dates/etc
of the "post" directories.

A "blog" is the directory into which a "scribe" is written when das-scribe
runs.

The util should probably have a command for creating a "post" under a "scribe"
like:
  $ das-scribe post new
  name of the post? <foo>
  post initialized in ./foo/foo.MD
  $

But that would be entirely too hard; would need to create files for metadata,
etc.

Instead, why not simply copy one directory structure to a target location,
turning .md files into html and plugging that in to a template. As an
optimization, don't copy to the destination if the destination has a newer
timestamp than the source file.

Furthermore, auto-generate a 'root' file that points to the newest .md post and
generate next/previous links based on date as well, where data is just
represented by the directory names in sorted order. Will need to re-generate the
newest existing post to fill in the "next" link.

For now, it may be easier to _always_ do the .md-->html conversion so we don't
need to worry.

Template file format will look like django with a few vars, like:

  <html>
    <head>
      <script...>
      <title>{{title}}</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div...>
        Last edited: {{date}}
      </div>
      <div...>
        {{content}}
      </div>
      <div...>
        <a href="{{prev_link}}">...</a>
        <a href="{{next_link}}">...</a>
      </div>
    </body>
  </html>

Title poses an issue, as it is metadata that must be stored somewhere
explicitly. Punt on it, for now.
