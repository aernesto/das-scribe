A "post" is a directory containing files.

A "scribe" is a directory containing multiple "post" directories and a .scribe
file, containing metadata about the titles/creation dates/last edit dates/etc
of the "post" directories.

A "blog" is the directory into which a "scribe" is written when das-scribe
runs.

The util should probably have a command for creating a "post" under a "scribe"
like:
  $ das-scribe post new
  name of the post? <foo>
  post initialized in ./foo/foo.MD
  $
